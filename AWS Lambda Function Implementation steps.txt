AWS Lambda Function Implementation: Steps Overview
In this implementation, we will create an AWS Lambda function and expose it via an API Gateway to handle HTTP requests, which will process query parameters and return dynamic responses.

Step 1: Create a Lambda Function

- Open AWS Lambda Console: First, access the AWS Lambda Console to start creating your Lambda function.
- Create a New Lambda Function: Choose to create a function from scratch. You will specify the function name, select the runtime (Python 3.x), and assign an appropriate IAM role (LambdaExecutionRole) for permissions.
- Add the Logic: In the Lambda function editor, you'll define the logic to process incoming requests, specifically extracting query parameters and determining the response based on the values passed.

Step 2: Set Up API Gateway
- Open API Gateway Console: Go to the API Gateway Console to create a new API.
- Create an HTTP API: Choose the HTTP API option to create a RESTful API that will integrate with the Lambda function.
- Configure the API: Define the API name, set up Lambda integration, and create routes to connect API methods (GET, POST) to the Lambda function.
- Deploy the API: After configuring the API, deploy it to a stage (e.g., prod) to make it publicly accessible.

Step 3: Test the API
- Access the API Endpoint: Once the API is deployed, use the generated Invoke URL in your browser or an HTTP client to test the Lambda function by passing query parameters in the URL.
- Verify Response: Based on the query parameter, the Lambda function will return a corresponding message as a JSON response, confirming that the setup is working.

Step 4: Clean Up (Optional)
Delete Resources: To avoid ongoing charges, delete the Lambda function and the API Gateway from the AWS Console when you're done testing.

In summary, these steps outline the process of creating a serverless application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to dynamically respond to HTTP requests, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution.
